From an early age, I've held a strong fascination for the world of technology. The pandemic provided an unexpected opportunity for me to rekindle this passion, and I embraced it by diving into the world of full-stack programming. Driven by creative thinking, strong organizational abilities, and a relentless desire to tackle new challenges, I have a proven track record of direct client engagement and seamless stakeholder collaboration in past projects.
